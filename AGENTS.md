# FEROX

- This repository contains one Vite application; keep application code in
  `src/` and static assets in `public/`.
- Prefer `.ts` and `.tsx` for source files and Node scripts. Do not create
  `.js`, `.cjs`, `.mjs`, or `.mts` source files; modern Node can run erasable
  TypeScript directly.
- Define source state with `atom.io`. Name tokens for their kind (for example,
  `questCountAtom`) and give public state explicit types.
- Give each exported JSX component a same-named sibling CSS Module
  (`AppShell.tsx` and `AppShell.module.css`). Import it as `css`, expose only
  `.class`, and attach `css.class` to the component root.
- Exported components must have multi-word names and render their matching
  hyphenated custom root (`AppShell` renders `<app-shell>`).
- Mirror rendered DOM in nested CSS. Prefer semantic elements, native form
  controls, and descriptive custom tags; never use `<div>`.
- Keep `src/globals.css` limited to resets, fonts, and semantic tokens. Keep
  component styling in CSS Modules.
- After component or CSS Module changes, run `pnpm lasertag check`. Run
  `pnpm check` and `pnpm build` before handing off changes.
